## About
We have created a website called Bookish, which is similar to Goodreads, for our Senior Capstone Project at MATES. Our book website would allow readers to log in, create a profile, set reading goals, and add books to their reading list. Users would also be able to keep track of their reading activity and discover new books to read. The site currently includes a homepage (where there is a summary of our website and where future book and reader leaderboards would be located), an About Us Page, a Login Page, a Sign-Up Page, and an All Books Page.

## Roadmap
      The key milestones within the first two weeks, from February 12 to February 23,  consisted of learning the languages necessary to complete the project. Malia completed multiple courses on Codecademy for front-end development and Caleigh completed some courses on Codecademy for front-end development and multiple for back-end development. We worked together to pick out the color palette for the website and design the homepage in Google Drawings. Finally, Caleigh found two datasets to use and started cleaning the data while Malia began coding the homepage in VS Code.
      During the next progress period, from February 26 to March 8, we both continued to complete courses on Codecademy. Caleigh found book datasets and uploaded book covers to VS Code. Malia finished coding the layout of the homepage using CSS Flexbox and Grid.
	From March 11 to March 22, Caleigh finished uploading the book covers to GitHub, continued working on the “Back-End Engineer” career path on Codecademy, and uploaded the book covers dataset into Python and Jupyter Notebook files. Malia designed and implemented the favicon for the website, designed the Sign-Up and Login pages in Google Drawings, and installed Live Sass Compiler to start using SCSS.
	During the next progress period, from April 8 to April 19, Caleigh researched SQL database to use, found a way to convert the Excel file into a SQL database on SQLite, started creating a sample book database in Postgres, and continued working on the “Back-End Engineer” career path. Malia created the hamburger menu and added a media query to hide the normal navigation links and show the hamburger menu on smaller screens.
	During the next two weeks, from April 22 to May 3, Caleigh added ten books from each genre into a test table in PostgreSQL, started to filter the main dataset, and switched from PostgreSQL to MySQL. Malia modified the sidebar and nearly finished the front-end for the About Us Page and Login Page. 
Over the next two weeks, from May 6 to May 17, Caleigh finished the test book database on MySQL, continued to filter the main dataset, started to work on the All Books Page, and continued working on the “Back-End Engineer” career path. Malia finished the About Us Page and the front-end for the Sign-Up and Login pages.
