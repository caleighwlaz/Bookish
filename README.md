### About
Our project is to create a website for readers to track their reading history, view book and user leaderboards, and possibly get recommendations. The site will allow readers to set goals to reach and add books to their reading list. Users will also be able to keep track of their reading activity and discover new books to read. Through the front-end (Malia), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will be used to create the website and the design elements. Through the back-end (Caleigh), Python, JavaScript, and MySQL will be used to calculate statistics for each user (such as average pages per book and average pages read per week), manage databases, and allow users to search for books on the website and add them to their lists. The concept of our website is similar to Goodreads with additional features such as book and user leaderboards.
