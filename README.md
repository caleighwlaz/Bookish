## About
We have created a website called Bookish, which is similar to Goodreads, for our Senior Capstone Project at MATES. Our book website would allow readers to log in, create a profile, set reading goals, and add books to their reading list. Users would also be able to keep track of their reading activity and discover new books to read. The site currently includes a homepage (where there is a summary of our website and where future book and reader leaderboards would be located), an About Us Page, a Login Page, a Sign-Up Page, and an All Books Page.
